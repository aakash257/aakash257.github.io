#### My current pursuit:

I an extremely intrigued when I think about my current (and evolving) goal to build text-mining based technology for humanity. I am currently in pursuit of building a text-mining tool that has several applications such as quantifying implicit-associations between concepts, identifying meaningful dimensions within such implicit-associations, building foundations for measuring implicit judgements in work places, etc. 

I am close to discovering a perspective and a solution which can help researchers in Psychology, Sociology, Marketing, Organization Behavior etc., to directly use it as a tool in their research and contribute in their fields, and can help analytic companies or companies that do analytics in improving their data engineering and analytic processes. I will provide more details as I finish finding the solution.
