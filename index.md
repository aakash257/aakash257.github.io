## Aakash Saxena

I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in Information Management at the Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado Boulder.

I am interested in understanding and applying distributed semantics embedded in word vector space models to build information analytic tools that identify the association between concepts in natural language. One of the applications is to identify differences in perceptions of a concept across cultures as embedded in natural language.

For the fall 2020, I am seeking research-based opportunities in Information Systems, Information Science, Computational Social Science or Applications of NLP. 

### Projects

#### Dissertation (D)
_Ongoing_

Quest: Can we identify semantics of a concept with respect to a specific context?
- A method to measure context-specific semantics of a concept from a general-purpose corpus using word embedding space.

#### Theory driven (T)
_Ongoing_

Quest: What are pragmatic/thematic categories? What is the relation between the attributes of such categories and frame elements of a semantic frame?
- T1. A method that uses the word embedding space to capture pragmatic categories, i.e., categories defined by sharing pragmatic contexts such as of evaluating leaders or products. _(Selected for oral presentation in INFORMS Annual Meeting 2019)_

Quest: Can we capture a semantic view of a social phenomenon such as stereotyping or judgements using word embeddings?
- T3. Perceived Leader-Gender Role-Congruity: A text-mining tool to measure the degree of congruence between leader-role and gender-role perceptions in the business context. _(Poster acceptance in International Conference on Computational Social Science 2019)_

_Completed_

Quest: What are pragmatic/thematic categories that exist in Hotel Reviews?
- T0. Text mining thematic categories for evaluative judgement: A test in the domain of hotel reviews and ratings.

#### Application driven (A)
_Ongoing_

Quest: What are some polarity cues in news articles?
- A2. Comparison of opinions in embedding spaces trained on subjective and objective corpora.

Quest: How to tackle deception in news leading to dis- or misinformation?
- A3. Demystifying perceptions in online news articles: A possible path to identifying news content susceptible to deception. 

_Closed_

Quest: What are the features in authors' vocabulary that can be captured by word embeddings?
- A1. An authorship attribution method to identify features to classify fiction-based authorsâ€™ texts using word embeddings. _(Poster acceptance in INFORMS Business Analytics 2019 Conference)_
