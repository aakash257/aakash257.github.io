## Aakash Saxena

I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in Information Management at the Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado Boulder.

I am interested in understanding and applying distributed semantics embedded in word vector space models to build information analytic tools that identify the association between concepts in natural language.

### Projects

#### Dissertation (D)
_Ongoing_

Quest: Building a text-mining tool to measure implicit associations in text. One of the applications of this tool is to identify perceived role congruity or incongruity between leader and gender, which I also discuss in this project.

#### Theory driven (T)
_Ongoing_

Quest: What are pragmatic/thematic categories? What is the relation between the attributes of such categories and frame elements of a semantic frame?
- T1. Framing analysis of travel experiences: Identifying the relationship between thematic categories and frames in travel reviews using Text Mining. Target Journal: ISR.
- T2. A method that uses the word embedding space to capture pragmatic categories, i.e., categories defined by sharing pragmatic contexts such as of evaluating leaders or products.

Quest: Word embeddings based semantic view of a social phenomenon such as stereotyping or judgements.
- T3. Perceived Leader-Gender Role-Congruity: A text-mining tool to measure the degree of congruence between leader-role and gender-role perceptions in the business context.

_Completed_

Quest: What are pragmatic/thematic categories that exist in Hotel Reviews?
- T0. Text mining thematic categories for evaluative judgement: A test in the domain of hotel reviews and ratings.

#### Application driven (A)
_Going into hibernation as I am currently working on my Dissertation_

Quest: What are some polarity cues in news articles?
- A1. Comparison of opinions in embedding spaces trained on subjective and objective corpora. Target Journal: ACL-EMNLP.

_Closed_

Quest: What are the features in authors' vocabulary that can be captured by word embeddings?
- A2. An Authorship attribution method to identify features to classify fiction-based authorsâ€™ texts using word embeddings.
