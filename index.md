## Aakash Saxena

I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in Information Management at the Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado Boulder.

I am interested in understanding and applying distributed semantics embedded in word vector space models to build information analytic tools that identify the association between concepts in natural language. One of the applications is to identify differences in perceptions of a concept across cultures as encoded in natural language.

For the fall 2020, I am seeking research-based opportunities in Information Systems, Information Science, or Applications of NLP. 

### Projects

#### Dissertation (D)
_Ongoing_

Quest: Can we build a text-mining tool to measure implicit associations in text and show its application in identifying perceived role congruity or incongruity between leader and gender?

#### Theory driven (T)
_Ongoing_

Quest: What are pragmatic/thematic categories? What is the relation between the attributes of such categories and frame elements of a semantic frame?
- T1. Framing analysis of travel experiences: Identifying the relationship between thematic categories and frames in travel reviews using Text Mining.
- T2. A method that uses the word embedding space to capture pragmatic categories, i.e., categories defined by sharing pragmatic contexts such as of evaluating leaders or products. _(Selected for oral presentation in INFORMS Annual Meeting 2019)_

Quest: Can we capture a semantic view of a social phenomenon such as stereotyping or judgements using word embeddings?
- T3. Perceived Leader-Gender Role-Congruity: A text-mining tool to measure the degree of congruence between leader-role and gender-role perceptions in the business context. _(Poster acceptance in International Conference on Computational Social Science 2019)

_Completed_

Quest: What are pragmatic/thematic categories that exist in Hotel Reviews?
- T0. Text mining thematic categories for evaluative judgement: A test in the domain of hotel reviews and ratings.

#### Application driven (A)
_Going into hibernation as I am currently working on my Dissertation_

Quest: What are some polarity cues in news articles?
- A1. Comparison of opinions in embedding spaces trained on subjective and objective corpora. Target Journal: ACL-EMNLP.

_Closed_

Quest: What are the features in authors' vocabulary that can be captured by word embeddings?
- A2. An Authorship attribution method to identify features to classify fiction-based authorsâ€™ texts using word embeddings.
