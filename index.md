## Aakash Saxena

I am a 5th-year Ph.D. Candidate in Information Analytics at the Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado Boulder.

I am interested in understanding distributional semantics, captured by word vector space models. My research work uses these models to build information analytic tools that identify context-sensitive associations between concepts in natural language. This research has several applications in:
- Identifying differences in perceptions of a concept across cultures as embedded in natural language (e.g. perceptions of the concept of startup in US vs India)
- Extracting biases associated with concepts (e.g. gender bias in the concept of a social role such as business leader)
- Demystifying perceptions about concepts in online news that are susceptible to deception (e.g. concept of unemployment) 

For the Fall of 2020, I am seeking research-based opportunities in Information Science, Computational Social Science, AI Ethics and Fairness, and Applications of NLP. 

### Dissertation (D)
_Ongoing_

Advisor: Jintae Lee

Quest: Can we identify semantics of a concept with respect to a specific context?
- A method to measure context-specific semantics of a concept from a general-purpose corpus using word embedding space.

### Other Research Projects

#### Theory driven (T)
_Completed_

Quest: What are pragmatic/thematic categories that exist in Hotel Reviews? (with Jintae Lee)
- **T**1. Text mining thematic categories for evaluative judgement: A test in the domain of hotel reviews and ratings.

_Ongoing_

Quest: What are pragmatic/thematic categories? What is the relation between the attributes of such categories and frame elements of a semantic frame?  (with Jintae Lee)
- **T**2. A method that uses the word embedding space to capture pragmatic categories, i.e., categories defined by sharing pragmatic contexts such as of evaluating leaders or products. _(Selected for oral presentation in INFORMS Annual Meeting 2019)_

Quest: Can we capture a semantic view of a social phenomenon such as stereotyping or judgements using word embeddings? (with Jintae Lee)
- **T**3. Perceived Leader-Gender Role-Congruity: A text-mining tool to measure the degree of congruence between leader-role and gender-role perceptions in the business context. _(Poster acceptance in International Conference on Computational Social Science 2019)_

#### Application driven (A)
_Ongoing_

Quest: What are some polarity cues in news articles?
- **A**1. Comparison of opinions in embedding spaces trained on subjective and objective corpora.

Quest: How to tackle deception in news leading to dis- or misinformation?
- **A**2. Demystifying perceptions in online news articles: A possible path to identifying news content susceptible to deception. 

_Earlier Projects_

Quest: What are the features in authors' vocabulary that can be captured by word embeddings?
- **A**3. An authorship attribution method to identify features to classify fiction-based authorsâ€™ texts using word embeddings. _(Poster acceptance in INFORMS Business Analytics 2019 Conference)_
